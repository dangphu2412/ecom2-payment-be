## Reasons to use Docker
- Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to create isolated environments to run your applications.
- Docker is a tool that allows you to deploy applications inside of software containers.

## Docker architecture
- Docker is a client-server application.
- Docker client is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker.
- Docker daemon is the server that manages Docker objects.
- Docker registry is a place to store Docker images.
- Docker objects are images, containers, services, volumes, networks, and plugins.
- Docker images are read-only templates that contain a set of instructions for creating a container that can run on the Docker platform.
- Docker containers are runnable instances of Docker images.
- Docker services allow you to scale containers across multiple Docker daemons.
- Docker volumes are used to persist data.
- Docker networks are used to allow containers to communicate with each other.
- Docker plugins are used to extend Docker functionality.
- Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions for Docker to build an image.
- Docker-compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
- Docker Swarm is a tool that allows you to create and manage Docker clusters.
- Docker engine is a client-server application that contains the Docker daemon, REST API, and CLI.
- Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use.
- Docker Trusted Registry is a private registry that you can use to store and manage your private Docker images.
- Docker Cloud is a service that allows you to deploy and manage your Docker containers in the cloud.
- Docker Machine is a tool that allows you to install Docker on virtual hosts.
- Docker Toolbox is a tool that allows you to install Docker on Windows 7 or 8.
